Your salvaging ops are longer then 60 minutes?  
You want to get something in return for grinding all the precious reputation?  

With ScrapyardPlus you can:
* buy up to 8 hours total (depending on your reputation)
* increment your current license in variable intervals from 5 minutes all the way up to 3 hours per order
* get discounts for bulk orders and your current standing with the owner of the scrapyard
* earn a lifetime-license for yourself or your alliance and never have to bother with buying an extension again (lifetime status is granted faction-wide!)
* configure all important things to suit your (or your servers) needs (``data/config/scrapyardplus.lua``)

## Roadmap
- ~~extend your current license instead of overwriting it~~
- ~~longer maximum duration for your license~~
- ~~reputation based benefits (max duration and discount)~~
- ~~split the license system into private & alliance so you can buy a personal one even if you are in an alliance~~
- ~~flexible duration selection via slider~~
- ~~lifetime license~~
- ~~regenerating wrecks / events to support lifetime licenses~~
- polishing current implementation with more texts, events, interactions
